The theme was ancient, jQuery was everywhere, and I kept putting off the inevitable migration. Then I decided to let an LLM do it. Here&amp;#39;s what happened when Claude Code spent an evening trying to modernize my setup.</description></item><item><title>Use Google Cloud Text-to-Speech to create an audio version of your blog posts</title><link>https://bart.degoe.de/use-google-cloud-text-to-speech-to-create-an-audio-version-of-your-blog-posts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Oct 2019 08:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://bart.degoe.de/use-google-cloud-text-to-speech-to-create-an-audio-version-of-your-blog-posts/</guid><description>Audio is big. Like really big, and growing fast, to the tune of &amp;#34;two-thirds of the population listens to online audio&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;weekly online listeners reporting an average nearly 17 hours of listening in the last week&amp;#34;. These numbers include all kinds of audio, from online radio stations, audiobooks, streaming services and podcasts (hi Spotify!). It makes sense too. Consuming audio content is easier to consume and more engaging than written content while you&amp;#39;re on the go, exercising, commuting or doing household chores.

Lunr.js requires an index file that contains all the content you want to make available for search. In order to generate that file, I had a kind of hacky setup, depending on running a Grunt script on every deploy, which introduces a dependency on node, and nobody really wants any of that for just a static HTML website.</description></item><item><title>Free SSL on Github Pages with a custom domain: Part 2 - Let's Encrypt</title><link>https://bart.degoe.de/github-pages-and-lets-encrypt/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 May 2018 22:34:06 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://bart.degoe.de/github-pages-and-lets-encrypt/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages&lt;/a> has just become even more awesome.
